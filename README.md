# QVM (Virtual Quantum Machine)
Virtual Quantum Machine: This is a lofi implementation of simulation of Virtual Quantum Machine designed to solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP). The TSP is a classical optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible path that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city. This virtual uses cycles with different behaviors to explore and find optimal path in a graph.
