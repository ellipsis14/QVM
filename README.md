# QVM
Virtual Quantum Machine: This is a lofi implementation of simulation of Virtual Quantum Machine designed to solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP). The TSP is a classical optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible path that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city.
